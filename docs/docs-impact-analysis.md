# Impact Analysis

The **Cloud-Native Finance Security Framework** addresses urgent cybersecurity and fraud challenges in U.S. financial and insurance sectors, with broader economic and societal impacts. This document quantifies its benefits, supporting EB-2 NIW Prong 1.

## Cybersecurity Threats
- **Cybercrime Losses**: $16.6B in 2024 (FBI IC3, 33% increase), with $1.571B in ransomware complaints (critical infrastructure, finance focus).
- **Data Breaches**: U.S. average cost $10.22M (IBM 2025, up 9%), global $4.44M. Finance/insurance: 61% of incidents (IBM X-Force).
- **Fraud Trends**: Synthetic identities in 15% of transactions (60% rise, 2025); $308.6B insurance fraud (NAIC).

## Economic Benefits
- **Risk Reduction**: 30% cyber risk cut via microservices (NIST 800-53), saving $36B by 2030 (Exhibit B).
- **Audit Efficiency**: 40% faster audits via AI compliance, saving $100M for 100+ institutions.
- **Fraud Detection**: Real-time analytics reduce $1B annually in fraud losses.
- **Job Creation**: Training 50 engineers by Q3 2027, creating 500+ indirect jobs (Exhibit D).

## Broader Impacts
- **Open-Source**: GitHub dissemination (MIT License) enables adoption by community banks, enhancing equity (CISA critical infrastructure goals).
- **Market Growth**: Supports $212B global security spending (Gartner 2025, 15% growth), addressing 500K job shortage (NIST NICE 2025).
- **Resilience**: Mitigates $10.5T projected cybercrime costs by end-2025 (Exhibit 0).
