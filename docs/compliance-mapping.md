# Compliance Mapping


The Cloud-Native Finance Security Framework ensures automated compliance with U.S. and international regulations, reducing penalties and aligning with modernization goals (EO 14028, CISA 2025-2026 Plan). This document maps the framework to key standards.

Regulatory Alignments





    NIST 800-53: Implements access controls, encryption (AES-256), audit logging via Istio/DataDog. Supports 30% risk reduction (Verizon DBIR 2025).



    NIST 800-207 (Zero Trust): Enforces mTLS, least privilege via Istio, integrated with AWS WAF.



    SOX/NAIC: AI-driven engine (AWS SageMaker/Comprehend) automates financial reporting, audit trails, reducing audit times by 40%.



    GDPR/CCPA: Data residency via AWS Regions, anonymization in Redshift/S3.



    HIPAA: Secure PII handling in RDS, encryption at rest/transit.

Implementation





    Microservices: /services/compliance/ handles regulatory APIs.



    Monitoring: /monitoring/ logs compliance events (Kibana/DataDog).



    Code: See /services/compliance/src/main/java/compliance/ for logic.

Impact

Automates compliance for 100+ institutions, saving $100M annually in penalties (projected, Exhibit B). Aligns with Treasuryâ€™s financial resilience goals.
